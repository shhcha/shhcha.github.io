## About

shhcha.github.io is not meant to be a showcase of my programming abilities, for that, look at [other repositories](https://github.com/shhcha?tab=repositories). The design of the website is heavily inspired by my own personal taste, digital minimalism (although hard to achieve in todays age), and outside influences (see [here](#acknowledgements)). 
Goals:
- [ ] Maintain and keep up-to-date
- [ ] Finalize design
- [ ] Actual blog?

Language: HTML
Platform(s): Web
Status: Stable\*

\* _Up for debate_
